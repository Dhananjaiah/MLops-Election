- [x] Know how to use Grafana and cloud monitoring tools

---

## Real-World Context

> **Story**: An ML team had hundreds of metrics but no clear visibility into system health. They created three dashboards: Executive (business metrics), Engineering (technical metrics), On-call (actionable alerts). Each stakeholder now has exactly the information they need. MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) dropped from 45 minutes to 10 minutes.

## Main Content

### 1. Dashboard Design Principles

Hierarchy: most important metrics at top. Signal-to-noise: avoid clutter. Actionability: every metric should inform decisions. Audience-specific: different views for different roles.

### 2. Key Dashboard Types

Health Dashboard: real-time system status. Performance Dashboard: latency, throughput. Model Dashboard: drift, accuracy, predictions. Business Dashboard: impact metrics.

### 3. Tools and Implementation

Grafana: flexible, open-source. CloudWatch/Stackdriver: cloud-native. Datadog/New Relic: commercial. Connect to Prometheus, InfluxDB, or cloud metrics.
