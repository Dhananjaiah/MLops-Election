# Lecture 3.2 – The Classic ML Lifecycle (CRISP-DM Style)

## In This Lecture You Will Learn

- [x] Understand the standard ML project lifecycle phases
- [x] Know what happens in each stage from data to deployment
- [x] Recognize where MLOps practices fit in the lifecycle

---

## Real-World Context

> **Story**: A startup hired 5 data scientists and told them: 'Build something with ML!' Six months later, they had 47 Jupyter notebooks, 12 trained models, and zero production systems. They had no process. CRISP-DM would have saved them.
>
> Understanding the classic ml lifecycle (crisp-dm style) is essential for successful MLOps implementation.

Most ML projects fail not from bad algorithms, but from process and organizational issues.

│  • Identify the problem clearly                                 │
│  • Choose appropriate solutions                                 │
│  • Implement with best practices                                │
│  • Monitor and iterate                                          │
│                                                                  │

### 3. Industry Examples

Real-world examples demonstrate these concepts in action:

| Company | Use Case | Approach | Outcome |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| Example A | Problem type | Solution used | Results achieved |
| Example B | Problem type | Solution used | Results achieved |
| Example C | Problem type | Solution used | Results achieved |

### 4. Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Follow established patterns
- Document your decisions
- Test thoroughly
- Monitor continuously

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip planning phases
- Ignore edge cases
- Deploy without testing
- Forget to document
