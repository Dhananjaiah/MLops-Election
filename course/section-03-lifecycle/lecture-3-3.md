# Lecture 3.3 – Where Things Break in Real Life (Why 'Just a Notebook' Fails)

## In This Lecture You Will Learn

- [x] Identify the gaps between research notebooks and production systems
- [x] Understand why most ML projects fail to reach production
- [x] Learn what needs to change for production readiness

## Real-World Context

> **Story**: A data scientist proudly showed their VP a notebook with 95% accuracy. The VP asked: 'Great! Can we use this with our live customer data?' Awkward silence. The notebook used hardcoded paths, random seeds, and had no error handling. Production was 6 months away.
>
> Understanding where things break in real life (why 'just a notebook' fails) is essential for successful MLOps implementation.

Most ML projects fail not from bad algorithms, but from process and organizational issues.

### 3. Industry Examples

Real-world examples demonstrate these concepts in action:

| Company | Use Case | Approach | Outcome |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| Example A | Problem type | Solution used | Results achieved |
| Example B | Problem type | Solution used | Results achieved |
| Example C | Problem type | Solution used | Results achieved |

### 4. Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Follow established patterns
- Document your decisions
- Test thoroughly
- Monitor continuously

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip planning phases
- Ignore edge cases
- Deploy without testing
- Forget to document
