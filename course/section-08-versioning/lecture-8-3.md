## Real-World Context

> **Story**: Which model.pkl Is In Production?
>
> A ride-sharing company had 15 data scientists all saving models as 'model.pkl' in different S3 folders. When a model started making bad predictions, they spent 3 days figuring out which file was in production. A model registry would have answered this in 30 seconds.
