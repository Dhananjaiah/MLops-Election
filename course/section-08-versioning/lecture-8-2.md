## Real-World Context

> **Story**: The 500GB Git Repo Disaster
>
> A startup committed their training data to Git ('it's version control, right?'). After a few months, the repo was 500GB and git clone took 4 hours. They had to rewrite history and lost all their old experiments. Lesson: Git is for code, not data.
