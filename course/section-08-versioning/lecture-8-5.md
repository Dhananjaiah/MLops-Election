# Lecture - Storing and Retrieving Artifacts in Pipelines

## In This Lecture You Will Learn

- [x] What are ML artifacts (models, preprocessors, configs, reports)
- [x] Artifact stores (MLflow, S3, Artifact Registry)
- [x] Versioning and retrieving artifacts in pipelines
- [x] Artifact naming conventions
- [x] Cleanup and retention policies

## Real-World Context

> **Story**: The S3 Bill That Was $40K
>
> A company stored every experiment's artifacts forever. After 2 years, they had 2 million model files in S3 costing $40K/month. 99% were from failed experiments nobody would ever use. Implementing retention policies (delete artifacts older than 90 days unless tagged 'keep') cut costs by 95%.
