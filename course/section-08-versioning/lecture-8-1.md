## Real-World Context

> **Story**: The Model Nobody Could Reproduce
>
> A healthcare ML team achieved 94% accuracy on a diagnosis model. Six months later, regulators asked them to reproduce the results. They couldn't—the training data had been overwritten, the exact sklearn version was unknown, and the preprocessing steps weren't documented. The model was rejected, costing $3M in wasted development.
