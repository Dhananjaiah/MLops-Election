# Lecture - Pipeline Building Blocks (Tasks / Steps / DAGs)

## In This Lecture You Will Learn

- [x] What is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- [x] Pipeline components: tasks, steps, operators
- [x] Task dependencies and execution order
- [x] Parameterization and configuration
- [x] Error handling and retries

## Real-World Context

> **Story**: The Pipeline That Ran Backwards
>
> A team wrote a pipeline where 'train model' ran before 'fetch data'. It failed with 'file not found'. They forgot to define dependencies. DAGs solve this by explicitly declaring 'train depends on fetch'—the orchestrator figures out the correct order.
