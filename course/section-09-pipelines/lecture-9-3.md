## Real-World Context

> **Story**: The Tool That Didn't Fit
>
> A startup chose Kubeflow because 'everyone uses it'. But they didn't have Kubernetes and spent 6 months fighting infrastructure issues. Airflow would have worked out-of-the-box on their existing servers. Choose tools that fit your infrastructure, not hype.
