## Real-World Context

> **Story**: The Data Scientist Who Worked Every Weekend
>
> Sarah manually retrained models every Friday: download data, clean it, train 5 models, pick best, deploy. It took 6 hours. She worked weekends to keep up. After automating with a pipeline, the same workflow ran nightly in 45 minutes while she slept. She got her weekends back.
