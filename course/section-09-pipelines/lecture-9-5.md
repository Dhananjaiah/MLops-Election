## Real-World Context

> **Story**: The One-Line Bug That Broke Everything
>
> A pipeline ran for 3 hours then failed at the last task. The bug was a typo in a file path. Without intermediate checkpoints, they had to rerun everything. Adding task-level artifact saving meant they could resume from the failed task, saving 2.75 hours.
